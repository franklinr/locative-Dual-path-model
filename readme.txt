## the model requires perl and LENS
## LENS is available here http://tedlab.mit.edu/~dr/Lens/
## a mac version is available here: http://hbrouwer.github.com/lensosx/

## To train models
## The input environments that are used to train the model come from the envtransgen, 
## envnopostverbtheme and envnodetomit files
## Test set is generated by envgramtest 
## runall.perl generates training and test sets, then runs the models specified in cmdfile.
## run with command:

> runall.perl & 

## the cmdfile has one line for each type of model.  It will train 30 of each (incrementing -s X each time).  
## “SET -s 0 envtransgen & & -m 50 | rmtransmes2.perl” creates the “transitive generalisation” model using 
## a grammar with mass noun determiner omission
## “SET -s 0 envnopostverbtheme & & -m 50 | rmtransmes2.perl” creates the “no post verbal theme role” model 
## using a grammar with mass noun determiner omission, no simple transitives, and no prepositional datives 
## “SET -s 0 envnodetomit & & -m 50 | rmtransmes2.perl” creates the “no article omission” model using a grammar 
## with no mass noun determiner omission 
## “SET -s 0 envtransgen &set directWordHidden 1& -m 50 | rmtransmes2.perl” creates the “no ccompress” model 
## using the transitive generalisation grammar (envtransgen) and removing the ccompress layer from the model 
## architecture (using the &set directWordHidden 1& parameter)

## results are saved into the working directory as the model runs and are automatically archived once finished 
## by runall.perl (using arcthis.perl). If you stop the model running before it has finished, run arcthis.perl 
## from the command line to clean up the folder.

## to produce stats and figures run modelstat.Rmd in the model working directory from the command line as follows:
# for the transitive Generalisation model
> gr sim*transgenm50
# for No compress model
> gr sim*Word*
# for Determiner omission model
> gr sim*omit*
# for No post verbal themes
> gr sim*post* 

## Here are the files in the model folder
## cmdfile - specifies model grammars and parameters
## model.tcl - passes model parameters to runall.perl
## runall.perl - runs the files below
## dualpath.in - lens files that creates model
## arcthis.perl - archives model files in the working directory
## decode9.perl - creates readable output file from results 
## syncode.perl - tags output for category and syntax, scores output correct/incorrect
## generate2.perl - generates message-sentence pairs from grammars
## gr - runs R script for computing statistics and produces html summary.  This requires the knitr package in R.
## translate.perl - translates output of generate2.perl into lens-readable format
## rmtransmes2.perl - removes messages from class B, C and D transitives
